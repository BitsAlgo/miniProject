        <p>Lemme gather the courage to say things in front of you!</p>

        <p>
          As I sit down to write this letter, I'm filled with excitement and
          nerves, but most of all, with love for you.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the moment we met, your beauty and charm captured my heart. Your
          laughter is contagious, and your kindness knows no bounds.
        </p>

        <p>
          But beyond your outward appearance, it's your inner beauty that truly
          sets you apart. Your kindness, compassion, and unwavering strength
          inspire me every single day. You have a heart of gold, and it's
          evident in the way you care for those around you.
        </p>

        <p>
          There's something else, too, something that might seem unconventional
          to mention in a letter like this, but I believe it's an important part
          of who you are. It's your unique ability to find humor and joy in even
          the simplest of moments, including your remarkable farting skills.
          Yes, you heard that right. While some may see it as an embarrassing
          trait, I see it as just another endearing quality that makes you who
          you are wonderfully authentic and unapologetically yourself.
        </p>

        <p class="center">BITS ALGO</p>

        <p>
          Please take your time to consider my proposal, and know that no matter
          what your decision may be, I will always cherish the moments we've
          shared and hold you dear to my heart.
        </p>

        <p>With all my love and admiration,</p>

        <p class="center">You are my today and all of my tomorrows&hellip;</p>
